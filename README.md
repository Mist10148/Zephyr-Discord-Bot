# Zephyr Discord Bot

A modular, multi-purpose Discord bot that bundles a **weather service**, a full-featured
**music player**, a **Google Gemini AI chat** companion, and **text-to-speech** — plus a
companion **Flask weather website**. Built with `discord.py` and organized into clean,
self-contained cogs.

---

## ✨ Overview

Zephyr started life as a single 3,000-line script and was rebuilt into a maintainable package:

- **Weather** — current conditions, forecasts, air quality, typhoon alerts, and a heat-index
  "class suspension" predictor (powered by OpenWeatherMap). Every weather command works as both
  a slash command and a classic prefix command.
- **Music** — a Groovy-style player streaming from **YouTube** and **Spotify**, with a queue,
  search-and-pick, seeking, loop modes, live audio effects (nightcore, vaporwave, 8D, reverb,
  bass boost, pitch…), and on-demand lyrics.
- **AI chat** — talk to the bot by mentioning it, replying to it, or DMing it. Backed by Google
  Gemini with a customizable persona, per-server/DM preferences, response-format options, local
  rate-limit tracking, and image generation.
- **Text-to-speech** — make the bot speak in a voice channel in your chosen language.
- **Website** — a small Flask app that shows Iloilo City's forecast and lets you search any city.

> The bot exposes **64 slash commands** and **13 prefix commands** across these features.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.13+**
- **FFmpeg** — required for all voice/music/TTS audio. The bot looks for it in this order:
  1. the `FFMPEG_PATH` value in your `.env`,
  2. a bundled `ffmpeg/` folder next to the project,
  3. FFmpeg on your system `PATH`.

  The binaries aren't committed to this repo (they exceed GitHub's file-size limit), so either
  [install FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your `PATH`, drop
  `ffmpeg.exe`/`ffplay.exe`/`ffprobe.exe` into an `ffmpeg/` folder, or point `FFMPEG_PATH` at it.
- **API keys / tokens** (all free to obtain):
  - A **Discord bot token** — [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    (enable the *Message Content*, *Server Members*, and *Presence* privileged intents).
  - An **OpenWeatherMap API key** — https://openweathermap.org/api
  - A **Google Gemini API key** — https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
  - **Spotify** client ID & secret — https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

## 🚀 Setup & running

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Mist10148/Zephyr-Discord-Bot.git
cd Zephyr-Discord-Bot

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure your secrets
copy .env.example .env          # Windows  (cp on macOS/Linux)
#   then edit .env and fill in your tokens/keys
```

### Run the bot
```bash
python run_bot.py
```
On startup it loads every cog, syncs the slash commands with Discord, and sets its presence to
`Listening to /help`.

### Run the website
```bash
python run_web.py
```
Then open **http://localhost:5000** — the home panel shows Iloilo City's forecast, and a second
panel lets you search the weather for any city.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | ✅ | Discord bot token |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | ✅ | OpenWeatherMap key (used by the bot *and* website) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ | Google Gemini API key |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ | Spotify app client ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✅ | Spotify app client secret |
| `FFMPEG_PATH` | — | Explicit path to `ffmpeg.exe` (otherwise auto-detected) |
| `WEB_APP_URL` | — | URL shown by `/use` (defaults to the project's web app) |
| `FLASK_HOST` / `FLASK_PORT` | — | Website host/port (default `0.0.0.0:5000`) |

`.env` is git-ignored and never committed. `settings.json` (per-context AI preferences and chat
history) is also kept local.

---

## 📝 Notes

- AI responses, the persona, model fallbacks, and all rate-limit logic are configurable in
  `zephyr/services/gemini.py`.
- `/generate` is an optional hook that looks for a separate `image_generator` module; if it's not
  present it simply reports that image generation is unavailable. The built-in Gemini image
  command is `/image-gen`.
- Privileged intents must be enabled in the Discord Developer Portal for chat and some features to
  work.
